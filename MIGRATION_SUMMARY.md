# Prisma Migration Summary

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully started the migration from direct Supabase database access to using Prisma ORM. Here's what we've completed:

1. **Created a Prisma Client Utility**:
   - Set up a proper Prisma client in `src/lib/prisma.ts` following Next.js best practices
   - Configured the client to prevent connection exhaustion in development

2. **Deprecated Supabase Database Access**:
   - Created warning stubs in `src/lib/supabase.ts` that throw errors when attempting database access
   - Maintained compatibility for potential Supabase Auth usage in the future
   - Added helpful error messages directing developers to use Prisma instead

3. **Updated API Routes**:
   - Converted `src/app/api/users/route.ts` to use Prisma for user management
   - Converted `src/app/api/campaigns/route.ts` to use Prisma for campaign operations
   - Converted `src/app/api/districts/route.ts` to use Prisma for district operations

4. **Created Documentation**:
   - `PRISMA_MIGRATION.md`: Explains the migration process and benefits
   - `MIGRATION_NEXT_STEPS.md`: Provides a checklist for remaining migration tasks
   - Updated `README.md` to reflect the new architecture using Prisma

5. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Created `.env.example` with both local and production database connection options
   - Updated documentation to reflect new environment variable requirements

## Benefits Already Realized

1. **Type Safety**: The Prisma schema provides full TypeScript type safety for database operations
2. **Better Developer Experience**: IntelliSense support for database queries
3. **Cleaner Code**: More readable and maintainable database access code
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Unified approach to database operations

## Next Steps

To complete the migration, follow the detailed checklist in `MIGRATION_NEXT_STEPS.md`. The high-level steps are:

1. Update all remaining API routes to use Prisma
2. Update client components and pages that use Supabase directly
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Optimize performance
5. Update documentation
6. Deploy to production

## Example Migration Pattern

Here's a quick reference for the most common migration patterns:

### Fetching Data

**Supabase:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('campaigns')
  .select('*')
  .eq('company', 'Avalern')
```

**Prisma:**
```typescript
const campaigns = await prisma.campaign.findMany({
  where: { company: 'Avalern' }
})
```

### Creating Data

**Supabase:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('campaigns')
  .insert({ name, company })
  .select()
  .single()
```

**Prisma:**
```typescript
const campaign = await prisma.campaign.create({
  data: { name, company }
})
```

### Updating Data

**Supabase:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('campaigns')
  .update({ status: 'active' })
  .eq('id', campaignId)
```

**Prisma:**
```typescript
const campaign = await prisma.campaign.update({
  where: { id: campaignId },
  data: { status: 'active' }
})
```

### Working with Relations

**Supabase:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('campaigns')
  .select(`
    *,
    leads(id, firstName, lastName, email)
  `)
  .eq('id', campaignId)
```

**Prisma:**
```typescript
const campaign = await prisma.campaign.findUnique({
  where: { id: campaignId },
  include: {
    leads: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        firstName: true,
        lastName: true,
        email: true
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Conclusion

The migration to Prisma is well underway and has already improved the codebase structure. By following the remaining steps in the migration plan, we'll achieve a fully type-safe, maintainable, and efficient database access layer that will make future development easier and more robust.
