# Migration Update: Fixing Supabase Database Access

## Issue Fixed

We encountered an error when trying to use Supabase for database access:

```
Error: DEPRECATED: Using Supabase for database access is no longer supported. Use Prisma instead. 
Import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma' and use the Prisma client API.
```

This error occurred because we had set up our `supabase.ts` file to throw errors when database methods are accessed, directing users to use Prisma instead.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated API Routes**
   - Converted `src/app/api/outreach-sequences/route.ts` to use Prisma instead of Supabase
   - Implemented proper transactions for creating sequences with steps

2. **Updated Client Components**
   - Converted `src/hooks/useLeads.ts` to use API calls instead of direct Supabase access
   - Removed Supabase client component imports

3. **Updated Pages**
   - Converted `src/app/campaigns/[id]/page.tsx` to use API calls instead of direct Supabase access
   - Replaced all Supabase queries with fetch calls to our API endpoints

## Key Patterns Used

1. **API-First Approach**
   - All database access now goes through API routes
   - Client components and pages only use fetch calls to API endpoints

2. **Consistent Request/Response Format**
   - PUT/POST requests use camelCase property names in the request body
   - API responses include properly named collections (e.g., `{ campaigns: [...] }`)

3. **Error Handling**
   - All API calls check for response.ok before proceeding
   - Error messages include HTTP status codes for easier debugging

## Benefits Realized

1. **Type Safety**
   - Prisma provides full type safety for database operations
   - API routes have consistent input/output types

2. **Cleaner Code**
   - Separation of concerns: UI components don't contain database logic
   - Consistent error handling patterns

3. **Better Developer Experience**
   - No need to handle database errors in UI components
   - Simplified data fetching logic

## Next Steps

Continue with the migration plan as outlined in `MIGRATION_NEXT_STEPS.md`:

1. Update the remaining API routes to use Prisma
2. Update the remaining client components and pages to use API calls
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Optimize performance
5. Update documentation
6. Deploy to production

This incremental approach allows us to migrate the application without disrupting functionality, while improving the codebase structure and maintainability.
