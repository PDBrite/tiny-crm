# Docker and Seed Data Setup Summary

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully set up a local development environment for the Lead Manager application with Docker and created a comprehensive seed script. Here's what we've done:

1. **Docker Setup**
   - Created a `docker-compose.yml` file that sets up a PostgreSQL database
   - Configured the database with proper health checks and volume persistence
   - Added Docker-related npm scripts to package.json for easy management

2. **Seed Data**
   - Created a detailed `prisma/seed.ts` script with realistic sample data:
     - Users (admin and member) with proper role-based access
     - Outreach sequences with multiple steps for both companies
     - Campaigns for both Avalern and CraftyCode
     - School districts with realistic data for Avalern
     - District contacts with various statuses
     - Real estate leads for CraftyCode
     - Touchpoints for both district contacts and leads

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created a `.env.local` file with proper database connection settings
   - Set up NextAuth configuration for authentication
   - Added default admin and member user credentials

4. **NPM Scripts**
   - Added Docker management scripts: `docker:up` and `docker:down`
   - Added database management scripts: `db:migrate`, `db:reset`, `db:seed`, `db:studio`
   - Added a combined setup script: `db:setup`

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`
   - Added troubleshooting guidance for common issues
   - Documented all sample data for easy reference

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Setup**
   - Run `npm run docker:up` to start the PostgreSQL container
   - Run `npm run db:migrate` to apply the Prisma schema
   - Run `npm run db:seed` to populate the database with sample data
   - Start the application with `npm run dev`

2. **Explore the Data**
   - Use Prisma Studio (`npm run db:studio`) to explore and modify the data
   - Log in with the sample credentials:
     - Admin: admin@example.com / adminpassword
     - Member: member@example.com / memberpassword

3. **Further Development**
   - Continue updating API routes to use Prisma
   - Enhance the seed script with more data as needed
   - Add automated tests for the database operations

This setup provides a solid foundation for local development, making it easy for team members to get started with a consistent environment and realistic sample data.
